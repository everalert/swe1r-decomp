game seems to have some weird render depth ordering issues wrt engine exhaust and the engines themselves
- see vehicle select and watch exhaust as pod rotates around
- possibly rendering the exhaust first, then engine, for each engine in order? (exh1 > eng1 > exh2 > eng2 > etc.)
- also, rotation of exhaust is constant per frame, not multiplied by frametime
