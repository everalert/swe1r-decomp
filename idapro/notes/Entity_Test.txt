aka PodEngineData
Player Pod Engine State
found at:
	[PodRaceData+0x84]		address of Test entity associated with that RaceData
	0xE29C44				address of the player Test entity (PodRaceData index 0 -> 'Test' entity)
	TODO: place whatever the entity system pointer path is here

unlike PodRaceData, these entities are not in order of racer
no guarantee that the player will be in any specific index
i.e. need to get pointer from PodRaceData for each racer, cannot rely on order
the AI structs seem to be the same length, possibly different internals (or, large unused chunks?)

		  .. seems to not have any other values
	@04	is moving, i.e. is not fully stopped/parked
		- ??? ref in 470610; braking related
		- set to 1 when accelerating
		- will only go back to 0 when pressing brake at very low speed
		- will not go to 0 even at a standstill until you press brake
		- nor if you press brake before going slow enough (doesn't buffer)
		- only other time observed is when you die until you start accelerating again
		- iirc this affects things like whether you have forced rotation while damaged (to confirm)
	@05	is player controlled (Locl)
	@06	is remote controlled (REMO)
	@07	is AI controlled (AAII)
	@08	character is track favorite; on if associated RaceData flags 0x20 is on

	@09	is braking
	@10	is repairing;  set on during postrace
	@11	queue pod reset with heal
		- turning this on will make you teleport to the spline, and resets engine damage to 0.1
		- increments respawn timer and then simply calls Test_DoRespawn__473F40 with 0.5 spline offset
		- seems to be the 'respawn' for remote players in multiplayer
		- shows "ka-pow" text in UiDrawRace_462B20
	@12	queue pod respawn

	@24	collided with ground due to fall speed this frame (fn_4774F0)
	@25	in 'zon' state;  not just on zon terrain
	@26	in 'zoff' state;  not just on zoff terrain
		- causes a hover state that automatically returns to 0 rotation with no input
		- stays on for the duration of the extended hover you sometimes get leaving tubes
		- presumably set by touching zoff terrain, but conditions not confirmed
		- min. speed forced to 75 in ApplyAccel
	@27	can fully stop (can 'park' pod)
		- set on when at low but not necessarily 0 speed
		- similar to 1<<04 but the speed threshold seems a little higher

	@05	on side terrain;  seems to make AI manual tilt, also ref in 4783E0_ApplyAcceleration()
