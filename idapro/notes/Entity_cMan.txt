see CameraSystem.txt for related notes about the underlying/related systems

there seems to be more than one of these entities generated
but not sure when the extra ones are used?
pointer to entity array at (EXE+BFE80)

all mat4 locations known i think, but not sure what they're all for


FUNCTIONS

sub_451D60
452600
	deals with respawn camera after death
	non-global constants in here: respawn invuln timer, explosion zoom-out distance, ...
453E00
	seems to handle the whole stack of camera processing for inrace stuff


CONSTANTS

0x453F1B	jump table used for switching between camera mode behaviour in Unk_CMan_HandleRaceCamera_maybe_453E00
		no 0 case (function decrements the value before feeding it into the switch)
		space for 3 or 4 extra cases
