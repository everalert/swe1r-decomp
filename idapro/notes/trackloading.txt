4368AC
	- triggered when loading from track select only
	- lots of stuff going on, looks like it could be some state setter stuff that happens before actual load

45BAB0
	- triggered when loading from track select and when restarting
	- does something with selected racer and track ids
	- skips the above based on some check at the top
	- references AAII and Locl magics

457410
	- possibly the actual function that does the whole load chain?
	- ends in "exit()", which seems to actually be an entity system handler
	- called with address of Hang entity

		OR [SWEP1RCR.EXE+10C454]


OLDER NOTES BELOW

check what's different about anakin/teemto code when loading modelblock

sub_41E660
	- called when pressing button to load race from cantina

loc_45E8E5
