- seems to be for managing menu/ui state in the cantina/shop area, incl. race settings
- not sure if also responsible for loading screen transitions, but guessing not because so far the entities seem to only be active within one loading section

OFFSETS

0x00	u32	Entity keyword
0x04	u32	Entity flags
0x08	i32	menu screen
		- not strongly linked to loaded area, it's only for selecting which screen to show, 0x38 is for the actual room/scene
		- does not do the in-race ui or pause menu
		-1	MENU NOT SET
		0	"Legal" (seen in 454D40)
		1	title screen menu, including file select and multiplayer
		2	"Enter Name" (seen in 454D40)

		18	cantina entry with character cutscene; state assigned async in 435240
0x0C		previous menu screen
0x10	u32	which text menu to show
		- what each value does depends on which menu screen you're on
		- setting it to 1 while on 'start race' screen makes it show n64 quality settings menu instead
0x14	u32	flags
		known values:
		1<<0	hang active (i.e. player in menus); controls whether anything runs in cb14, cb1C, cb20
		1<<1	if on in cb14, toggled off; set on in fn_45BB80
		1<<2	?? set on during: cantina screen transition (fn_454D40), drawing vehicle sel (fn_435700)
		1<<3	?? set on in Hang__440C10, fn run if start of filename is CRD
		old notes:
		4 in race
		5 cantina/shop
		6 loading race->cantina afted quitting; code around 45A0A0 runs here
		7 loading race->cantina after finishing; loc_45A2A1 runs here
0x18	??	set to 0 in setup function fn_45AB50
0x1C	??	set to 3 in setup function fn_45AB50

0x48	..
0x4C	..
0x50	i8	?? index used to ref vec3 array
		arrays at 0x4C457C (fn_435700 draw vehicle select) and 0x4C4510 (fn_459150)
		randomized in latter, then result vec3 passed into an Elmo struct
0x51	b8	shows developer photo on title screen when on
		toggled in fn_435240, done on title screen
		toggle conditions: if ( v6[7] == 11 && InputBitsetLocal_Raw_50C908[0] & 4 && SLOBYTE(InputBitsetLocal_JustOn_50C918[0]) < 0 )
0x52	??	two bytes possibly unused

		draws vehicle upgrades if on in cb20
0x64	i32	?? race option (index 5); see fn_43B880 (draw track detail menu)
		seems to decide what behaviour to do during 'Abrt' event; 2 is supposed to reset Hang settings
		probably splitscreen multiplayer related setting
		game crashes if starting normal race with it on?
		sets racers to 1 if on, playercount <=1, not tournament or time attack, skipping
		seems connected to +0x14; used in cb24; default set in fn_45BD90 (0), set to 2 in fn_435240
		see also fn_45BAB0
0x68	i32	?? race option (index 6); see fn_43B880 (draw track detail menu)
		seems to set where to send the player after running 'Abrt' event
		run on menu screen 0 ("legal")
		seems connected to +0x14; used in cb24; default set in fn_45BD90 (-1), ref in fn_434EC0, fn_434EA0 load race macro
		range -1..20
		loading race with it set to 20 makes the game go back to the menu instead of to the race
		setting >= 0 will make 'Scen' entity/entities? active during LoadRace function
