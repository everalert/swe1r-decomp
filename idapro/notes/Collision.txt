MFG research
- only 2 places that position is written
	- end of Test0x18(47AB40)
	- grounded roll function fn_477C30 (called about 2/3 down cb1C)
- seems like the magic is happening in Test_CalculateSpeed_478D80
- Test+0x013C (model ptr) is the one that actually gets used for figuring out speed
	- 0x140 used elsewhere, i think this confirms that a ref mismatch is at play?
	- actually, seems 13C doesn't get updated at all, maybe it's the track root node?
- Test_CheckCollision__477940 does detect collision when landing on mfg surface
- fn_44ABC0 breaks on mfg past the fn_444D10 if clause
	- rarely breaks on any collision, but does also break on the exe skip sticking spot
- fn_4774F0 has the code that causes bounce


FUNCTIONS

0x4314F0    void GetPlaneFromVertices(COLLISION_PLANE *pPlane_out, VEC_3 *pVtxA, VEC_3 *pVtxB, VEC_3 *pVtxC)
		- fills out a COLLISION_PLANE based on input verts


COLLISION_PLANE
0x00	vec3	plane normal; could be facing backward?
0x0C	f32	distance from origin squared
0x10 END

COLLISION_RAY
- basically a LOCATION with a distance value appended
0x00	vec3	translation/position
0x0C	vec3	normal
0x18	f32	length
0x1C END
