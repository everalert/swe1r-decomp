// original function took a vector3 by reference, and modified it to be normalized
// this functionality is implemented separately in this codebase

// it also seemed to return the vector3's magnitude as a float? ignoring for now, will revisit if anything actually uses it

// see: Vector3.hpp -> void vec3::normalize(Vector3 *a)
